# Powerwall
A repository for communicating with and controlling a Tesla Powerwall 2.

This is an expansion of the work by XXXXXX and others, by including additional endpoints.

As time permits, I will also be uploading Python scripts to perform various functions to read data from and send commands to the Powerwall.  These Python scripts are designed to run as cron jobs on a Rapsberry Pi Zero W dedicated to these tasks.

The endgame for this project is to analyse forecasted PV output projections for the following day from Solcast.com.au for my rooftop solar pv array and determine the appropriate charge reserve to set for load shift charging.
